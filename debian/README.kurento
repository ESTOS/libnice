Kurento changes from upstream
=============================

- Use 'debhelper (>= 9)': Debian packager uses version 10, but that
  is only available in 16.04 as backport. Default version for both 16.04
  and 14.04 is 9.
  Also changed in file 'debian/compat'.

- dh-autoreconf: debhelper 10 already depends on dh-autoreconf, but version 9
  doesn't.



Debug symbols
=============

By default, 'dh_strip' in Debian will generate '-dbgsym' packages automatically
from each binary package defined in the control file. This supersedes the need
to define '-dbg' files explicitly and manually:

    https://wiki.debian.org/AutomaticDebugPackages

This mechanism is also working in Ubuntu, but only if the package
'pkg-create-dbgsym' is already installed at build time, so we need to install
it in our Docker build images.



Note for migration to Ubuntu 18.04
----------------------------------

Looks like new debhelper in 18.04 LTS already does automatically what pkg-create-dbgsym was doing before, so pkg-create-dbgsym is not needed any more.
